[Blog A](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19557497): The iPhone 5 is boring.

[Blog B](http://curiousrat.com/home/2012/9/17/boring.html): Customers are buying the iPhone 5; Blog A is an idiot.

[Blog C](http://fuckjetpacks.com/read/apple_avoids_the_temptation_of_jetpack_design): Smart Companies make boring products.

The 3 reactions after every major Apple news: Apple is overrated, Apple is above reproach, This is what Apple just did, so all companies should do that.  Wash, rinse, repeat.
