[Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is a text editor created by [John Skinner](http://www.twitter.com/sublimehq) for Windows, OSX, and Linux.  It is widely used, especially among web programmers, and has been praised for its speed, ease of use, platform support, and excellent plugin support.  There have been several efforts around the web to create guides for those looking to start using Sublime Text 2, including the ["officially unofficial" documentation](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/index.html) and the ["officially official" documentation](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/) on the Sublime site. However, none of them provide a comprehensive and approachable introduction for somebody just getting started with Sublime Text.  Thats the goal of this guide.

## First Steps

#### Installation

1. You can download Sublime Text [here](http://www.sublimetext.com/2).  Sublime Text is free to try, with only an occasional "nag notice" to interrupt unlicensed usage.  If you're using it on a regular basis though, you are of course encouraged to [buy it](http://www.sublimetext.com/buy).  
2. Installation is mostly straightforward, packages are provided for OSX, Windows and Linux in their native formats (.dmg,.exe,.tar.bz2).  Note that the Linux version may not be compatible with all versions of Linux.  It is statically linked to libraries that some older distributions, including RHEL5 may not provide.  
3. A crucial first step to being productive with Sublime Text is to install Package Control.  This can be found at the [developer's website](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) along with [installation instructions](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation).
