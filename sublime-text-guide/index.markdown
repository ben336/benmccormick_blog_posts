[Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is a text editor created by [John Skinner](http://www.twitter.com/sublimehq) for Windows, OSX, and Linux.  It is widely used, especially among web programmers, and has been praised for its speed, ease of use, platform support, and excellent plugin support.  There have been several efforts around the web to create guides for those looking to start using Sublime Text 2, including the "officially unofficial" documentation on the sublime site.
